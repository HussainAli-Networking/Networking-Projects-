# Networking Projects

This repository contains hands-on networking projects and lab implementations focused on enterprise network design, WAN technologies, and security using defense-in-depth principles.

All projects are built, configured, tested, and verified in simulated environments, primarily using **EVE-NG**, with an emphasis on real-world behavior, verification commands, and documentation.

## About Me

I am a networking student and hands-on lab engineer with strong practical experience in enterprise network design, WAN technologies, and secure infrastructure implementation.

My work focuses on:
- Designing realistic multi-site networks
- Implementing secure WAN and routing solutions
- Verification-driven troubleshooting using CLI
- Clear technical documentation and diagrams

- AAA using RADIUS
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Basic Layer 2 security mechanisms

**Services Implemented:**
- Windows Server
  - Active Directory (AD DS)
  - DNS
  - DHCP
  - IIS Web Server
  - FTP
  - Email services

**Environment:**
- Fully simulated and validated in **EVE-NG**
- Multi-site, multi-VM lab design
- Verification using routing, VPN, and security show/debug commands
